This program sends a random philosophical quote 
to any emails. Quotes not in a separate txt. They're in the main file.


#CHANGE THIS FIELD TO MATCH YOUR ACCOUNT:

sender = "gmailaccount@gmail.com"
password = "password here"


#If you wish to use a different email provider,
#Change the Gmail API under: "# Add the Gmail API." 


It also sends a random goodbye from a list, 
or a greeting based upon the time.

You can upload the code to IBM Cloud and set up a scheduler, so
your code will run whenever you wish.
